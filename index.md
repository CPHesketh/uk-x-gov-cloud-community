## Our Vision
To provide a forum for multidisciplinary cross-government collaboration on cloud:
*	To help each other in the adoption and maturation of our use of cloud
*	To share case studies, and lessons learned
*	To discover and evaluate emerging trends in cloud usage

## How are we doing this?
* Engaging with the community on [UK Government Digital](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) Slack - in the [#cloud](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/C04FA6GL49J) channel
*	We have a small facilitation group that is doing some of the initial setup

## Do you want to help facilitate the group?
Drop an email to [Benjamin Bennett](mailto:benjamin.bennett@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) or [Chris Hesketh](mailto:chris.hesketh@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we'll reach out.
